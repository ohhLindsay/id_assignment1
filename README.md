# Lindsay's Portfolio

This is a website that i've created to showcase my work that i've done so far. 

## Design Process

This website that i've created is mainly to target company that is hiring where i can showcase my work to them and through the website they will be able to contact me. For my design process, i first started planning a wireframe on how i wanted to layout my website (for example, where i wanted to place the text or images as well as the alignment). Since this is about a portfolio website, i created a navigation bar where it will be easier for them (audience) to navigate the site easily. As for the contact page, it will be easier for them to contact me for any enquiry without the need for them go through long process etc logging in their email to contact me.


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

At the index page which is the homepage, i splited it into two column so that i can add my picture at one
side and the other side is for me to briefly introduce myself. As for below, i created a manual slideshow where i included some of the work i've done. 
On the Navigation bar, there is a portfolio dropdown that shows Design and Web Development. I splited my profolio into two html file, one is for design and the other is about web development so i can split it up and include my work in the different page. Lastly, i also created a contact me page, where the audience can contact me if they have any enquiry.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - The manual slideshow that is shown in the index page (homepage) allowed user to briefly look through the work i've done.
- Feature 2 - The navigation bar, allowed the user to easily navigate to the desire page that they want.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
- I would like to create a more interactive website in the furture  to interact more with the audience. This is one of my favourite interactive website : https://simplychocolate.dk/

### Features Left to Implement
- Other than having a more interactive website, i also would like to include feature like an audio slideshow or a simple fast game feature.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
